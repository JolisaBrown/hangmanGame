  <h1>Welcome to Hangman! </h1>

   <row>
  	<h4> 
      There's a poor man whose life literally hangs in the balance.</h4>

      <h4> To save him, you just need to guess the word. With each word, you'll have 60 seconds and five strikes to determine the correct answer, but once those five strikes are gone, the game ends. If you can't save him before the forty seconds are up, the game also ends. </br></br></br>

      But it's not all doom and gloom! You get to pick your word category in the initial "Easy Stage" and win two points per letter. We'll pick the category for you in the "Intermediate Stage" after three words, and you'll have the opportunity for three points per letter. </br></br></br>

      And in the "Hard" open category after five words, all the categories come together, but you also have the chance to win up to five points a letter. Try and beat the High Score!! </br></br>

      Just a hint: You might want to try the vowels first. (They show up a lot)
